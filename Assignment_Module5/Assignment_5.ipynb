    "In your favorite protein there is a stretch of six amino acids that contain two proline residues.  Curiously, in this particular 6mer, the two prolines are right next to each other.  You wonder how rare this is.  You have gathered all 6mer sequences in the entire proteome and found that in only 1% of these 6mer sequences are the prolines next to each other.  For a 6mer amino acid sequence that contains two prolines, if amino acids were purely randomly distributed, what is the expected frequency of 6mers that contain consecutive prolines?  Are consecutive prolines depleted from naturally occuring protein sequence?\n",
