We know that RNA-binding proteins like RBFOX2 often recognize their RNA targets through interaction with short RNA sequences (kmers).

    "1.  Go through each file and count the number of occurences of each 5-mer.  This might be best stored as a dictionary of the form {kmer : number of occurences}.\n",

Calculate a log2 enrichment for each for each kmer in the affected relative to control by dividing the frequency of the kmer in the affected sequences to its frequency in control sequences and taking the log base 2 of the ratio.  Remember that the frequency of a kmer is that number of occurences of that kmer divided by the number of occurences of all kmers.  Frequencies must be between 0 and 1.  Enrichments will be positive if the kmer is enriched in the enhanced sequences and negative if enriched in the control sequences.\n",
    "3.  Calculate the statistical significance of that enrichment with a Fisher's exact test.  This can be done by importing the fisher_exact function from the scipy.stats module.  See the [documentation](http://lagrange.univ-lyon1.fr/docs/scipy/0.17.1/generated/scipy.stats.fisher_exact.html) for fisher_exact for help.\n",

    "5. Sort kmers by their corrected pvalues.\n",
    "6. Write a file with the following columns for every kmer:\n",
    "      kmer, frequency_in_enhanced, frequency_in_ctrl, enrichment (log2), uncorrected pvalue, corrected pvalue\n",
    "7. Print the first 10 lines (the top 10 kmers sorted by pvalue) in your code block.      \n",
