    "Often, it's not a good idea to work on raw expression values.  Work on tranformed (for example, log-transformed) can sometimes be more informative (if not more mathematically correct).  The scatter plot we produced to compare gene expression values in conditions 1 and 2 is a good example.  It would be better to instead look at the correlation between logged (let's say log10) values.  Produce a scatter plot comparing the logged expression values.\n",

    "Your friend has done a very similar experiment, looking at the expression of the same genes in the same conditions.  You might like to know how well your two datasets agree with each other.  One way to do this would be to correlate the log2 fold changes that you observed with the log2 fold changes that your friend observed.  Write code to obtain the Spearman correlation coefficient for your two log2 fold changes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, is the correlation stronger or weaker than what you would expect by chance?  One way to find this out would be to randomize your data and get correlations for the random data.  If you did this many times (say, 500 times) you could see where your real correlation coefficient fell within the distribution of control random correlations.  Write code to do this, finishing with a z-score comparison of the real correlation coefficient and the random values.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: A z-score compares a single value (like your real corrleation) to a distribution of other values (like all the random correlations).  Lets define your single value as x and the distribution of the other values as y.  The z-score is defined as (x - mean(y)) / (standarddeviation(y))\n",

Think of it like a scatter plot.  For each point, the value in the first list is the x coordinate and the value in the second list is its y coordinate.\n",
