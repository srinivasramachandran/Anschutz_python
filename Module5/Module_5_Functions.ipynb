    "- **len()**\n",
    "  - Return the length (number of items) in the list.  Returns an integer.\n",
    "- **max()**\n",
    "  - Return the largest item in the list.  For numeric items, this is the largest number.  For text items, this is the last item when the items are sorted alphabetically.\n",
    "- **min()**\n",
    "  - Return the smallest item in the list.  For numeric items, this is the smallest number.  For text items, this is the first item when the items are sorted alphabetically.\n",
    "- **sorted()**\n",
    "  - Return a sorted version of the list.  This **does not** happen in place and the list itself is unaffected.  Numeric values are sorted lowest to highest and text values are sorted alphabetically.\n",
    "- **sum()**\n",
    "  - Return the sum of all items in a list.  Only valid if all items are numeric.\n",
